Find peaks

**Qt wrapper over SciPy's [find_peaks_cwt](http://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.signal.find_peaks_cwt.html)**


This is a very small "stuff" done for my little brother who was in a hurry :) It's probably useless but eh, who knows.

Anyway it can serve as an example for wrapping matplotlib in a Qt GUI.
